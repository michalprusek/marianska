## The Issue in 30 Seconds

**Problem**: Proposed bookings block checkout days from being booking checkin days  
**Cause**: Uses INCLUSIVE date check (<=) instead of EXCLUSIVE (<)  
**Fix**: Change <= to < in 4 locations (2 files)  
**Impact**: Enables standard hotel checkout/checkin on same day  
**Risk**: LOW (aligns with proven confirmed booking model)

---

## Code Changes Required

### File 1: database.js

Line 1484:
```javascript
- AND ? >= pb.start_date AND ? <= pb.end_date
+ AND ? >= pb.start_date AND ? < pb.end_date
```

Line 1492:
```javascript
- AND ? >= pb.start_date AND ? <= pb.end_date
+ AND ? >= pb.start_date AND ? < pb.end_date
```

### File 2: data.js

Line 580:
```javascript
- checkDateStr <= pb.end_date &&
+ checkDateStr < pb.end_date &&
```

Line 581 (Comment):
```javascript
- checkDateStr <= pb.end_date && // INCLUSIVE end date for proposed bookings - blocks checkout day
+ checkDateStr < pb.end_date && // EXCLUSIVE end date - allows checkout day for next booking
```

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Read the quick fix guide
- [ ] Understand the difference between confirmed and proposed date models
- [ ] Make changes in database.js (2 lines)
- [ ] Make changes in data.js (2 lines)
- [ ] Create confirmed booking: 2025-10-06 to 2025-10-08
- [ ] Create proposed booking: 2025-10-08 to 2025-10-10
- [ ] Verify Oct 8 is now available/clickable
- [ ] Test back-to-back bookings work

## Technical Notes

### Why DateUtils.isNightOccupied is the Standard
```javascript
// Correct model (used for confirmed bookings)
nightDate >= bookingStart && nightDate < bookingEnd;  // EXCLUSIVE end

// Incorrect model (currently used for proposed bookings)
date >= pb.start_date && date <= pb.end_date;         // INCLUSIVE end
```

The proposed booking logic should use the same model as confirmed bookings.

### SSOT Principle
**Single Source of Truth**: All date comparisons should use consistent logic
- Currently: 2 different models ‚ùå
- Should be: 1 unified model ‚úÖ

### Edge Day Definition
- **Edge Day**: Exactly ONE night around the day is occupied
- **Status**: Still available for new bookings
- **Calendar Color**: ORANGE (clickable)
- **Why It Matters**: Enables standard hotel operations

## FAQ

**Q: Is storage broken?**  
A: No, storage is correct. The issue is in the CHECKING logic.

**Q: Is this a recent bug?**  
A: The bug appears intentional (documented in code comment) but is incorrect.

**Q: Will this break confirmed bookings?**  
A: No, confirmed bookings use DateUtils.isNightOccupied which is already EXCLUSIVE.

**Q: What happens to existing proposed bookings?**  
A: They auto-expire after 15 minutes, so no migration needed.

**Q: How many tests do I need?**  
A: Just create 2 back-to-back bookings to verify it works.

---

## Summary

The proposed bookings system blocks checkout days unnecessarily due to using INCLUSIVE (`<=`) date checking instead of EXCLUSIVE (`<`). This can be fixed by changing 4 code locations (2 files) to use the same date model as confirmed bookings. The fix is low-risk, high-impact, and enables standard hotel checkout/checkin operations.
