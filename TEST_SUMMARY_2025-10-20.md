## ⚠️ Security Findings

### Potential XSS via innerHTML (53 instances)

**Risk Level**: LOW (in current context)

**Why Low Risk**:
- Most uses are clearing containers (`innerHTML = ''`)
- Server-side validation prevents malicious input
- Admin panel is password-protected
- No direct user input → innerHTML path found

**Recommendation**: Replace with safer DOM manipulation methods

**Priority**: MEDIUM (not urgent, but should be addressed)

---

## 📋 Recommendations

### 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY (Next Deployment)

1. **Add CSP Headers** - Prevent XSS attacks
2. **Test Booking Flow** - Manual verification of end-to-end booking
3. **Test Admin Panel** - Verify all admin operations work

### 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY (Next Sprint)

1. **Replace innerHTML** - Use createElement or textContent
2. **Cross-Browser Testing** - Test on Firefox, Safari, Mobile
3. **Add Promise .catch()** - Handle all promise rejections

### 🔵 LOW PRIORITY (Backlog)

1. **Code Quality** - Address 949 low-priority items
2. **Accessibility Audit** - Run automated tools
3. **Performance** - Code splitting, lazy loading
